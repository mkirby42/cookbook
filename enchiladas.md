# Enchiladas
Enchiladas are awesome, but kind of a pain in the ass to make at home. I have some time savers to make it less so.

## 1. Paint your tortillas

Ref - Chile two step from enchilada queen
Probably better results, but messy af

Easier and less messy is to brush bueno brand red chile sauce on each tortilla with a bbq brush. You need to brush both sides of the first and last tortillas, but only one side of all the others. Stack the tortillas on a plate and when your finished painting them all press down on the stack to make sure the unbrushed side of each tortilla gets into contact with the one below it. Then microwave for 1 min.

Your tortillas are now ready to roll

## 2. Rolling
Have your filling on one side is a large bowl
Put some filling in and roll the enchilada using the previously rolled enchilada as back support. 

When they are all rolled pour/brush your sauce on. You want every one to be covered, but not swimming in sauce.
